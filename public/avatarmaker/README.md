# Inochiteam *AvatarMaker*

Thank you for purchasing the avatarMaker, we put a lot of work and
effort into creating a cured and polished web app. If you appreciate
our work, please rate it on the Envato marketplace, it helps us a lot.

Although we have included a copy of the documentation in this
package, we strongly recommend you to use the online version.
It is always updated and refined using your feedback.
You can find it here: https://inochiteam.com/documentation/avatarmaker/

If you experience any problem setting up your new avatarMaker or
you find a bug don't hesitate and contact us via email at
inochiteam@gmail.com, using the comments section on the marketplace
or the contact form on our website.

Hoping that you will enjoy the fruit of our hard work
The InochiTeam
